# Hooks API

### Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
* Hooks let us organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units to prevent faced **Huge components** that are hard to refactor and test.or **Duplicated logic** between different components and lifecycle methods.or **Complex patterns** like render props and higher-order components.

*  the usage of Hook is to enable you to add state into function instead of converting the function to class by using Hook inside function 


* Hook use in the top level of the React functions
* Hooks return to react function only ; can't use in JS function 
* ``Hook state`` is method to declare state in react function
