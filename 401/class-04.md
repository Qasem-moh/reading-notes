# Why Use Test Driven Development

## What is TDD?

_Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice enabling developers to create proper specifications about how their code should be written and implemented. Fundamentally, TDD is a practice when a programmer writes a functional test before building a code._

_The idea of TDD originated in the middle of the 20th century, and since then has been applied in many areas. TDD was afterward rediscovered in 2002 by Kent Beck, an American Software Engineer and the creator of Extreme Programming methodology. He described it in his book Test Driven Development: By Example._

_The original description of TDD was in an ancient book about programming. It said you take the input tape, manually type in the output tape you expect, then program until the actual output tape matches the expected output. After I'd written the first xUnit framework in Smalltalk I remembered reading this and tried it out. That was the origin of TDD for me. When describing TDD to older programmers, I often hear, "Of course. How else could you program?" Therefore I refer to my role as "rediscovering" TDD. - Kent Beck_
