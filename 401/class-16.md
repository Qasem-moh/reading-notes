# AWS
* **AWS** : Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services

## Virtual Machine (VM) : is the ability of software that allows us to run an operation system with another operation system like:
1. VirtualBox
2. VMWare

## Virtualization
* **Hypervisor :** software allowing us to create virtual machines (VMs)
* **Virtualization** is the fundamental technology that powers cloud computing. This software separates compute environments from physical infrastructures, so you can run multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously on the same machine.
* Virtualization is software that manipulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to a service that results from that manipulation. You can't have cloud computing without virtualization
## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
*  is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
* It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
*  Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. 
* It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
* Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model.
* it's offer the fastest processors in the cloud and it's are the only cloud with 400 Gbps ethernet networking.

##  Elastic Beanstalk
* enable you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications.
* reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control.
* You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.



# Terms
* **WRRC** *Web-Request-Response-Cycle *
* **Pub/Sub** is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.
* **Server** A server is a computer that serves information to other computers

# Q
1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
- The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app.
- send req from browser side to router ==> router send it to controller to handling action ==> action receives the request and passes it on to the view to show page as html then controller send the response to the browser

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
- the heart to manage requests

3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
- make your local code work remotly
