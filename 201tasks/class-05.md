# Images

**Images matter because…**

![](https://d27jswm5an3efw.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/2019/07/insert-image-html-2-768x304.jpg)

Studies show that people remember 80% what they see and only 20% what they read. In fact, there’s research that suggests that 65% of people are visual learners. MIT also found that the human brain can process images in as little as 13 milliseconds. These and many other statistics favor the idea that images are powerful means of communication. Perhaps, their most important function is that they remove language barriers, as they are easily understood by everyone in the world.

On the Internet, images are used for all kinds of reasons: to enhance websites, to illustrate stories, in ad displays, to present products or services, as stand-alone “a picture is worth a thousand words” meaning-rich tools, and sure, on social media.

3.2 billion images are shared online every day, according to Brandwatch, many of which “mention” brands without the use of text. So how do businesses track images featuring their brands? Through “visual listening,” which is essential media monitoring for images. It uses image recognition technology to uncover visual mentions (usually company logos) of a brand and not only watermarks. Visual listening can identify logos on actual objects, like a store sign, or a label on a product. For brands, this can determine social media mentions in all kinds of contexts, including discovering brand advocates, finding out how people are using a product, identifying misuse of the logo, and the list goes on. Brandwatch Image Insights gives a fair idea of how brands can use visual listening to monitor social media.

On top of it all, “Generation Y prefers a picture-based method of communicating information rather than a text-based method,” according to a 2010 paper by Soussan Djamasbia, Marisa Siegelb, and Tom Tullisb titled Generation Y, web design, and eye tracking. Generation Y, the Millennials, grew up with technology and the internet and they will soon take over as the most significant segment of consumers, surpassing the baby boomers and Generation X.

## How to Choose the Right Images for Your Website

All the elements of your website work together to either improve or hamper your conversions. That includes things like your copy, your layout, your font size, your call-to-action, your headlines, and yes, your images.

Marketer [Jeff Bullas states](https://www.jeffbullas.com/6-powerful-reasons-why-you-should-include-images-in-your-marketing-infographic/) that posts with images get 94% more total views than posts without.

Images help you invoke certain emotions in your readers and can even turn off readers completely if you’re not careful.

Image choice is part art, part science. The art comes down to trusting your choices and not being afraid to experiment. The science is knowing your audience and choosing images in line with their needs.

Below we offer our best tips for choosing the best image for your needs, every single time.

1. Use Emotional Images

People make decisions with their emotions, and back things up later with logic.

Be mindful of the emotions you’re trying to evoke when choosing your images. If your business primarily deals with lawyers, then you obviously won’t be using images of a relaxed couple on a beach.

You want your images to align with your reader and support the things you’re saying.

Take a look at this very simple image from Smart Blogger:
![Emotional](https://automationagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/emotion-1.png)

It’s not large, but it helps to create a certain feel for the rest of the post.

2. Don’t Use Bad Stock Photos

People can spot poor stock photos a mile away. Stock photos might have worked back in the ’90s, but we live in a different age of the internet. Sure, stock photos still exist, but they’re a different breed than the stock photos of a decade ago.

Bad stock photos look staged, cheesy, and give off a feeling of inauthenticity. You’ll want to choose images that are the exact opposite of this.

Luckily, there are a lot of free stock photo sites with images that don’t give off the stock photo feel. Here are a few of our favorites:

[Life of Pix](https://www.lifeofpix.com/)
[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

3. Always Go Human

Surprise! People love connecting with other humans. Even if your business primarily deals with a piece of technology or an app, adding a human element will help to build a connection.

Just look at this image from Apple. It’s simple, but the little human touch goes a long way towards helping people bond with your product.

4. Don’t Think About Yourself
   When you’re trying to find the perfect image, it’s easy to end up choosing something YOU like and call it a day.

But that can lead you down the wrong path.

When you’re choosing an image, you need to leave yourself out of the equation. Always have your target reader in mind when choosing an image.

Ask yourself:

- Will this image help my reader understand the content?
- Will this image further my message or be a distraction?
- Am I in love with this image, or does it actually add value?

5. Choose Images That Support Your Goal
   Please, don’t just add images at random. Just because you heard that images improve conversions doesn’t mean you should populate your site with random images.

You need to be strategic with your image choice and placement.

For example, if your goal is to boost the sales of a specific product, then include a lot of real pictures of happy customers.

If you can couple these images with text, or a testimonial from those happy customers, then even better. [Neil Patel](https://neilpatel.com/) has a ton of simple testimonial images sprinkled throughout his blog posts.

![Support Your](https://automationagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/testimonial.png)

6. Don’t Forget to Test Your Images
   Images aren’t something that you set and forget. They are a flexible and living aspect of your website.

The first image you choose might not be the best one for your needs, or even resonate with your customers. If you have images on a landing page, then you might consider testing a few different ones, until you land on an image that gives you the highest conversion rates.

7. Go for High-Quality and Clear Images
   Always use images of the highest possible quality. Don’t make your reader squint or force them to re-size your images.

The stock photo sources we highlighted above will give you a large enough selection of high-quality photos to get started with.

If your site requires personal photos of your employees or company, then most camera phones today will provide you with photos of which the image resolution is high enough.

Just keep in mind, if the images you’re uploading to your site are tiny, don’t work well with your content, or are slightly blurry, then scrap them and pick another one.

**Where to Store Images for Your Website**

When an image is ready for the web, you need to use the correct HTML5 markup to add it to your page, but you also need to know where to store your image.

You can store images for your website in several places. Image storage works best if it uses relative URLs stored somewhere on the website with your other HTML files. You can store images in the same root as your HTML files, which gets confusing if you have a lot of files, or you can create a graphics or images directory in the root file for your website.

Here are three compelling reasons to store images on your own site:

- **Control**: When images reside on your site, you have complete control over them. You know your images aren’t going to disappear or change, and you can work to optimize them.

- **Speed**: If you link to images on another site, you never know when that site may go down or respond unbelievably slowly. Linking to images on someone else’s site also causes the other site’s owner to pay for bandwidth required to display it on your pages — on another site!

- **Copyright**: If you show images from another site on your pages, you may violate copyright laws. If you must do this, obtain permission from the copyright holder to store and display images on your website.

How to Insert an Image in HTML Page?

Images can be easily inserted at any section in an HTML page. To insert image in an HTML page, use the <img'> tags. It is an empty tag, containing only attributes since the closing tag is not required.

Just keep in mind that you should use the <img'> tag inside <body'>…</body'> tag. The src attribute is used to add the image source i.e. URL of the image. The alt attribute is for adding alternate text, width for adding width, and height for adding the height of the image.

## Color

_The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:_

- RGB values
  These express colors in terms of how much red, green and
  blue are used to make it up. For example: **rgb(100,100,90)**
- HEX codes
  These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,
  green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #
  sign. For example:**#ee3e80**
- color names
  There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized
  by browsers. For example: **DarkCyan**

**Background Color**

_background-color_

_CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background
for that box._

You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors:

_RGB values,hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page)._

If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent. By default, most browser windows have a white
background, but browser users can set a background color for
their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background
is white you can use the background-color property on
the <body'> element.

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them). When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.
The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue —just like on a television screen Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that
say R, G, B. The hex value is provided
next to the pound or hash # symbol. There is also a
good color picking tool at: colorschemedesigner.com

# Color in CSS

Color can really bring your pages to life.
In this chapter we will look at:

1. How to specify colors, as there are three common ways in
   which you can indicate your choice of colors (plus extra
   ways made available in CSS3)

2. Color terminology, as there are some terms that are very
   helpful to understand when it comes to picking colors

3. Contrast, and ensuring that your text is readable

4. Background colors for behind either your entire page or
   parts of a page

What you will learn about colors in this chapter will then be
used in subsequent chapters when it comes to looking at
colors of text and boxes in CSS.

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

## RGB values

These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and

example: rgb(100,100,90)

## HEX codes

These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,

## color names

There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

We look at these three different
ways of specifying colors on the
next double-page spread.
CSS3 has also introduced
another way to specify colors
called HSLA, which you will
meet near the end of this chapter
on page 255-256.
Foreground Color

Above each CSS rule in this
example you can see how CSS
allows you to add comments
to your CSS files. Anything
between the /_symbols and
the_/ symbols will not be
interpreted by the browser.
They are shown in grey above.
The use of comments can help
you to understand a CSS file
(and organise it, by splitting a
long document into sections).
Here, we have used comments
to indicate which method is used
to specify each of the different
types of colors

/_color name_/
h1 {
color: DarkCyan;}
/_hex code_/
h2 {
color: #ee3e80;}
/_rgb value_/
p {

## RGB Values

Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers
between 0 and 255. rgb(102,205,170) This color is made up of the
following values:
**102 red**
**205 green**
**170 blue**

## Hex Codes

Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code

# 66cdaa

The value of the red, 102, is expressed as 66 in hexadecimal code. The 205 of the green is expressed as cd and the 170 of
the blue equates to aa.

## Color Names

Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
MediumAquaMarine There are 147 color names supported by browsers (this color is MediumAquaMarine). Most consider this to be a limited color palette, and it is
hard to remember the name for each of the colors so (apart from white and black) they are not commonly used.

## Hue

Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.

## Saturation

Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.

## Brigh tness

Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the
color would be ver

## Text

**Typeface Terminology**

- **Serif**
  Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are
  known as serifs.
  ![](https://www.postprepress.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/This-is-a-serif-font.-768x466.png)
  
- **Sans-Serif**
  Sans-serif fonts have straight
  ends to letters, and therefore
  have a much cleaner design.
  

- **Monospace**
  Every letter in a monospace (or
  fixed-width) font is the same
  width. (Non-monospace fonts
  have different widths.)

![](https://i.ibb.co/WynmrpP/000.png)

**font-family**

The font-family property allows you to specify the
a typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.
The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want
to use. The people who are visiting
your site need the typeface you have specified installed on their
computer in order for it to be displayed.
You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that,
if the user does not have your the first choice of typeface installed,
the browser can try to use an alternative font from the list.

**font-size**

The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:

**pixels**

Pixels are commonly used because they allow web
designers very precise control over how much space their text
takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px .
percentages The default size of text in
browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of
12px, and 200% would be 32px. If you create a rule to make all
text inside the <body'> element to be 75% of the default size (to make it 12px), and then specify another rule that indicates the content of an element inside the
<body'> element should be 75% size, it will be 9px (75% of the
12px font size).

**ems**
An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m. We will look at these measurements in greater detail on the next page.
