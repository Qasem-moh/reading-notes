## What is a text editor?
_The formal definition is: “A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files.”
Essentially, a text editor is a program on you computer that allows you to create and edit a range of programming language files. this is the place where you write your code!
Text editors handle “hand coding” many different languages, i.e.: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and so forth._
_
What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some
of the most important features are: 
1. code completion; 
2. syntax highlighting; 
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue), 
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. You might find some other features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start._

_also, some features to Look for in a Text Editor
When it comes to text editors, there are common features that they all share. It’s what makes a text editor a text editor. Here are a few:

* Easy to use and navigate (similar to a good word processor)
* Find and replace feature (so you can change a single word in the whole file with a few clicks)
* Cut, Copy, Paste (again, similar to word processors)
* Ability to handle UTF-8 encoded text (also unlike a word processor)
* Syntax highlighting (unlike your word processor, this makes it easier to read code and pick up any errors)
* Customizable appearance (such as modifying font size, color schemes, etc., of your editor which optimizes your work zone)
* Extensibility – (provide some plugin mechanism, or is scriptable, so a programmer can customize the editor with additional features – this is more advanced)_

## Best Text Editors for Beginners
_1.  Sublime Text
OS Compatibility: Mac, Windows and Linux
Cost: $70*
Website: [HERE](www.sublimetext.com)_

_The Sublime Text editor is not free, but there is a free trial. I’ll let you in on a little secret, though: this “trial” lasts indefinitely. (At least at the time of this writing.) BUT if you enjoy the Sublime editor, and use it frequently, you should register it._

_I’ve done lots of online tutorials and in-person classes where Sublime Text is the recommended text editor for beginners. At the same time, lots of professionals and more experienced programmers use it. So it’s basically awesome for all skill levels._

_Aside from working on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines, Sublime has wonderful syntax highlighting, a slough of attractive color schemes, the ability to add packages and more._

_The Sublime Text editor is currently in its second version. However, Sublime Text 3 is in beta. Below is a screenshot from my computer of working in a Ruby on Rails app in Sublime Text 2._

_ 2. Notepad ++
OS Compatibility: Windows only
Cost: Free
Website: [HERE](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)_

_I’ve never used Notepad++ because I don’t have a Windows computer. BUT that doesn’t mean I can’t pull together some resources from the web._

_Notepad ++ features syntax highlighting, tabbed files, split screen editing and synchronized scrolling, auto-completion, smart highlighting, etc. Basically everything a good text editor needs._

_After watching lots of online coding tutorials, it’s definitely a popular option for Windows users._

_3. TextWrangler
OS Compatibility: Mac only
Cost: Free
Website: [HERE](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)_

_The TextWrangler code editor is the little brother to BBEdit and part of Bare Bones Software. But, unlike BBEdit, TextWrangler is free._

_It has everything a good text editor should: syntax highlighting, easy navigation and so forth._

_This was the text editor recommended and used in the book “Learn Python the Hard Way” by Zed Shaw and the Coursera Python class I recently finished._

_Below is a screenshot below taken from my computer of a Ruby on Rails file in TextWrangler. (Same file as the Sublime editor photo above.)_

_4. gedit
OS Compatibility: Linux (and now Windows and Mac)
Cost: Free
Website: [HERE](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit)_

_Gedit is another text editor I have not personally used. It’s been around for fifteen years. It’s free, open source and built for ease of use. Also, I believe more recently, it is available on Windows and Mac._

**What’s my favorite text editor?!**

Glad you asked.

_I LOVE VSCode. It’s the first text editor I ever downloaded and I’m not looking back_.

_I’ve played with sublime, but there’s something about the vscode Editor. It’s attractive, easy to use … plus all my friends use it._

_But, truly, Sublime is a great editor – that’s why so many use it.
Ultimately, the best text editor is the one you work most efficiently with. As a beginner, test out a few to see which you enjoy most._

_In the end, all text editors help you accomplish the same end-goal. You just have to find the editor that gets you there the quickest_
