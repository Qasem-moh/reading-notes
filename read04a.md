# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

_JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web. JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS. JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data._
  
_JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible._

_JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.

var <variable-name>;

var <variable-name> = <value>;

var one = 1; // variable stores numeric value

var two = 'two';  // variable stores string value

var three;  // declared a variable without assigning a value
***
In the above example, we have declared three variables using var keyword: one, two and three. We have assigned values to variables one and two at the same time when we declared it, whereas variable three is declared but does not hold any value yet, so it's value will be 'undefined'.

Declare Variables in a Single Line
Multiple variables can also be declared in a single line separated by comma.

Example: Multiple Variables in a Single Line
var one = 1, two = 'two', three;
