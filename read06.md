# How JavaScript Makes Web Pages more Interactive
_JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter fee_
## ACCESS CONTENT
_You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or ext from an HTML page. For example:_
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of ema i 1
***
## MODIFY CONTENT
_You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:_
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element
***
## PROGRAM RULES
_You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:_
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a fo rm, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).

**JavaScript**
_encompasses amny of the traditional rules of programming._

_it can make the web page fell interactive by respodingf to what the user does_

## HTML & CSS
### A Quick Pefresher
#### HTML Element
_An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag._
***
**HTML Elements**
_The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>_
