# How JavaScript Makes Web Pages more Interactive
_JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter fee_
## ACCESS CONTENT
_You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or ext from an HTML page. For example:_
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of ema i 1
***
## MODIFY CONTENT
_You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:_
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element
***
## PROGRAM RULES
_You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:_
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a fo rm, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).

## HTML & CSS
### A Quick Pefresher
#### HTML Element
_An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag._
***
**HTML Elements**
_The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>_

**CSS Properties and CSS Rules**
You style HTML elements via CSS properties. Different HTML elements may have different CSS properties you can set. CSS properties can be organized into CSS rules. A CSS rule groups a set of CSS properties together, and applies all properties to the HTML elements matched by the CSS rule. Both CSS properties and CSS rules will be covered in detail in this text.
***

**CSS Properties**
A CSS property styles an aspect of an HTML element. Here are a few examples:

In this example two CSS properties are applied to the div element: The border and the font-size properties.

A CSS property declaration consists of a property name and a property value. The property name comes first, then a colon, and then the value. Here is the general pattern a CSS property declaration follows:
**property-name : property-value**
_property1 : property-value1;
property2 : property-value2;_
***
**CSS Rules**
A CSS rule is a grouping of one or more CSS properties which are to be applied to one or more target HTML elements.

A CSS rule consists of a CSS selector and a set of CSS properties. The CSS selector determines what HTML elements to target with the CSS rule. The CSS properties specifies what to style of the targeted HTML elements.

Here is a CSS rule example:

**Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps.**
**1: DEFINE THE GOAL**
_First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve._

**2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT**
_To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow._
**3: CODE EACH STEP**
_Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. As tempting as it can be to start coding straight away, it pays to spend time designing your script before you start writing it.
