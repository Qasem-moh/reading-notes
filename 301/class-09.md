# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

1- What is functional programming?

        Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data

2- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

            It returns the same result if given the 
            same arguments


            *- It returns the same result if given the 
            same arguments (it is also referred as 
            deterministic)

            *-It does not cause any observable side effects

3- What are the benefits of a pure function?

            * Immutability
            * Referential transparency
            * Functions as first-class entities
            * Higher-order functions
            * Filter

4- What is immutability?

        When data is immutable, its state cannot change 
        after it’s created. If you want to change an 
        immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you 
        create a new object with the new value.



5- What is Referential transparency?

        This pure function  have the same output, given 
        the same input.
